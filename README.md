# SPYSCALP

What if the UNIX philosphy of software design was applied to SPY ETF algorithmic options trading?

Enter SPYSCALP. The *NIX-like approach to algorithmic trading.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is the first and oldest exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the United States, designed to track the performance of the S&P 500 Index. And the SPY ETF also consistently has the highest volume of options trading on the US derivatives market today. Why not create an application that leverages algorithms to trade against SPY options contracts?

SPYSCALP is a turnkey and ready-to-use solution for algoritmic SPY ETF options trading. No more manualized order entry. No more emotional or cognitive obstructions to implementing strategies. No more information overload during the decision process to open or close positions. SPYSCALP implements and executes the strategies for you in a (relatively) simple text-based user interface (TUI). By default, SPYSCALP runs in an interactive-TUI mode using the Textual framework, although CLI command inputs are still possible in the spirit of the UNIX philosphy.

Written in Python programming language and compiled with Nuitka, it's almost guaranteed to be fast with minimal RAM usage after the executable is automatically decompressed at startup. Emphasis is placed on "almost" guaranteed, because the limiting factor to speed is the quality and stability of your internet connection.

Prerequisites:
* For legal residents/citizens of the United States only.
* Basic knowledge of technical analysis, technical indicators, and risk management.
* Comfort and familiarity with running CLI and TUI applications.
* Brokerage account with Tastytrade® in good standing, without account restrictions. At this time, only the Tastytrade® brokerage platform is supported.
* Willingness to embrace risk of significant losses, even when it's least expected. See disclaimer.
